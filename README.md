Decker game, from 2001, made by Shawn Overcash.
Remade in Javascript in 2018 by Palparepa.

This is a simple update for 2025 by TideGear that intends to make the game more playable in a mobile browser while still supporting desktop. I may implement some other fixes. I do not intend to change the gameplay at all unless they are bugfixes.
